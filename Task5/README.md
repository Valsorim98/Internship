* I used **GECON TCP-508N Super Smart S8-3CN** controler and a configuration utility from the manufacturer to change the device ID address.

The device is using COM5 port, Baud Rate - 9600, ID - 1, Parity - None, Word Length - 8, Stop bits - 1, IP address:192.168.1.75, Service port:502, by default. I changed the ID address from 1 (default) to 5.
